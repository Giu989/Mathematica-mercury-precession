# Mathematica-mercury-precession
This is the mathematica thingy project that we're doing! - basically model the precession of Mercury

Stage 1: Start with mercury and sun (almost done - don't have actual data but we have a working ellipse)
Stage 2: Add other planets to the orbit
Stage 3: Model the effect of the planets on Mercury
Stage 4: Change mass/etc of planets to see if it changes anything
Stage 5: Maybe add relativty? We'll discuss afterwards.
